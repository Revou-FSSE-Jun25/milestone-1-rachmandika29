          In this very simple web pages I'm gonna introduce myself in a very
          brief manner so you can have a glimpse of idea of who am I, what's my
          experience, what have I created and how to reach me out if you
          interested to work something with me.

      <section id="about" aria-labelledby="about-title">
        <h2 id="about-title">Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a simple guy who born at the end of the 20th century, which I
          would consider myself lucky to born at this period considering that I
          can grew at the same time with how internet grows. Growing up I'm
          always close with internet and pop culture, which really shapes my
          interest and my view around the pop culture and the internet culture
          itself. In short, I can describe myself as a "cultured geek". Does it
          sound cocky? Me too, you're not alone.
        </p>

        <h2 id="experience-title">My Experiences... So far.</h2>
        <p>
          I'll start with my education, which is quite bland actually as I took
          <span class="highlight">Communication Science</span> as my major.
          Which if you currently do the same, trust me, at the end of your study
          you will raise a question about "why am I study a thing that we can
          learn it on a Public Relations Short course?". But don't listen to me,
          Trust yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          But thankfully life is not determined by what have you study, but it's
          determined by your "taste". So here's the list of my experiences and
          what have I done so far:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I started my career from a
            <span class="highlight">small trucking service startup</span> in
            Jakarta as the
            <span class="highlight">Customer Service Specialist</span> who
            managed the client's booking for the trucking and also to manage the
            "supply and demand" of the service based on our truck availability.
            I stayed here for around 2 years.
          </li>
          <li>
            My previous experiences might not yet touch anything about internet
            and technology, but those previous 2 years helped me a lot to learn
            much about the communication technique and strategy, in which it
            lands me to my next path of the career which I'm still currently on
            right now. From the last 2 years I join the
            <span class="highlight">Global Web Hosting Company</span>
            who has all around the worlds users, I joined as the
            <span class="highlight"> Customer Technical Specialist</span> who my
            daily task mainly to help and troubleshoots client's daily issue
            with their hosting; from Domain management, Website Deployment and
            migration issue, up to talk about the billings and renewals plan of
            their hosting.
