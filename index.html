          In this very simple web pages I'm gonna introduce myself in a very
          brief manner so you can have a glimpse of idea of who am I, what's my
          experience, what have I created and how to reach me out if you
          interested to work something with me.

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a simple guy who born at the end of the 20th century, which I would consider myself lucky
          to born at this period considering that I can grew at the same time with how internet grows.
          growing up I'm always close with internet and pop culture, which really shapes my interest and my view
          around the pop culture and the internet culture it self. <br/>
          <br/> 
          In short, I can describe myself as a "cultured geek". Does it sounds cocky? Me too, you're not alone.

          <h2>My Experiences.. So far.</h2>
          <p>
            I'll start with my education, which is quite bland actually as I took Communication Science as my major.
            Which if you currently do the same, trust me, at the end of your study you will raise a question about
            "why am I study a thing that we can learn it on a Public Relations Short course?". But don't listen to me,
            Trust your self.
          </p>
          <p>
            But thankfully life is not determined by what have you study, but it's determined by your "taste".
            So here's the list of my experiences and what have I done so far:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I started my career from a small trucking service startup in Jakarta as the Customer Service Specialist
              who manage the client's booking for the trucking and also to manage the "supply and demand" of the service
              based on our truck availability. I stayed here for around 2 years.
            </li>
            <li>
              My Previous experiences might not yet touch anything about internet and technology, 
              but those previous 2 years helped me a lot to learn much about the communication technique and strategy, 
              in which it lands me to my next path of the career which I'm still currently on right now. 
              From the last 2 years I join the Global Web Hosting Company who has all around the worlds users, 
              I joined as the Technical Specialist who my daily task mainly to help and troubleshoots client's daily issue with their hosting; 
              from Domain management, Website Deployment and migration issue, up to talk about the billings and renewals plan of their hosting.
